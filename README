= hs-twitter - Programming Twitter from Haskell =

'hs-twitter' is a Haskell package providing a binding to
the Twitter API - 

  http://twitter.com/
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation

The binding is functionally complete (Christmas 2008), letting you write
applications in Haskell that accesses Twitter streams and updates your
own.

For more info on use, please visit: http://haskell.forkIO.com/twitter

= Getting started =

For some code samples showing you how to get started using this
API binding, have a look at Web/Twitter.hs at the top.

= Building and installing =

This package is provided in Cabal form, so only thing you need to
do to get going is:

  foo% runghc Setup configure --user  # that option being optional
  foo% runghc Setup build 
  foo% runghc Setup install

(or, if you are versed in its ways, "cabal update ; cabal install twitter")

The package depends on a bunch of other packages though, so you
need to have them built&installed, as well. They are:

  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP
  * json:  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/json
  * utf8-string: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string
  * mime: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mime

('cabal install' will take care of chasing these down for you, btw..)

= Authentication =

When using this API binding to build your own Twitter applications,
authentication is required ...
